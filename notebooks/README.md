# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks documenting each stage of the analysis:  
1. **Data Cleaning & EDA** — initial exploration, outlier detection, and insights.  
2. **Feature Engineering** — creation of new features such as tenure groups and RFM scores.  
3. **Modeling** — training, evaluation, and comparison of machine learning models.  

Each notebook is structured to be reproducible and easy to follow.
