🛒 Customer Churn Analysis in E-Commerce

Welcome to the E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis project — an end-to-end data story exploring, cleaning, modeling, and visualizing customer churn patterns in an e-commerce business.
This project combines data engineering, SQL, machine learning, and dashboard design using Tableau to deliver actionable insights for reducing churn.

⸻

📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand why customers leave and to identify patterns that can help businesses retain them.
We analyze customer behavior using RFM segmentation, tenure analysis, and satisfaction trends, and build a predictive machine learning model to forecast churn.
The final results are presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard for business decision-makers.
